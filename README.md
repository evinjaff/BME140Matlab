# BME140Matlab
A showcase of all of the work done in Fall 2019 in Matlab for solving realisitc Biomedical Problems. Bellow are details of various pieces of code writen.

## Rubber Band Drop
Crunched data from lab in which we streched a rubber band with varying degrees of weight. Using data from the experiment, determined the Young's Modulus of a rubber band.

## Heart Model
Modeled the human circulatory System using different methods throughout the semester. For my final lab, used Euler's method to construct diastolic and systolic Pressure-Volume loops of the heart, as well as tracked the change in compliance over systole and diastole.

## Circuit Matrix
A circuits problem was given in lab, and extra points were awarded if we solved the matrix in Matlab.
